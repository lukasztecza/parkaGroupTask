1. Write a function that will sanitize input.

Consider an application in which a website user can post comments to an article. Write a function that will sanitize the comment submission. The function:

 

-        should allow 4 basic HTML tags are allowed: a, b, i, img

-        should analyze security issues and sanitize input accordingly

-        may consist of calls to empty functions that describe what you want to do (i.e. you do not have to write code for these called functions)

 

2. Design a mysql database and write SQL queries.

Business objects:

-        Hierarchical categories with names.

-        Items for sale with name and price.

-        Item type. Each item has a type - for example table, cup, fork.

 

Relations:

-        One category can hold many items.

-        One item can be placed only to one category.

-        One item has only one type describing it.

 

Write sql/php:

-        To get all items from category 'X'

-        To get all items from category 'X' including all sub-categories

 

3. Write a function that calculates a passed array’s depth.

-        Array is passed to the function as parameter.

-        Calculate maximum level of nested arrays.

-        Extra point if you can check array structure for links making infinite cycle.

 

4. Design a php class or classes.

Write a class (or classes) that demonstrates your knowledge of OOP:

 

-        The php class is used to send website notifications over different media (mail, SMS, IRC).

-        Create a function to send a message (actual function may be empty)
